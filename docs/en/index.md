AI Solution Kit provides solutions of various use cases, allowing you to use out-of-box AI solutions, such as text recognition (OCR) solution, image super resolution solution, pornography detection solution, human segmentation solution.

## Benefits
*  Best practices for multiple scenarios

You can find the code implementation of most common AI use cases. All solutions and applications included are vetted by Amazon Web Services.

*  Out-of-box AI features

The solutions automatically create RESTful APIs through Amazon API Gateway. After deploying the solution, you can send HTTP POST requests to use the AI functions. The deployment guides provides all API test methods (e.g. Postman) and offers sample codes.

*  Open Source and Customization

All the solutions are open sourced. You can use the solutions and applications for free. If you have different use cases, you can take the source code as reference to make your own implementation.
